1-2-3 instruction for kiji with phoenix

Even though the instructions are as easy as 1-2-3, but a little detail won't hurt.

Here is the command that ran for me under the current distribution of Phoenix:

~/phoenix-3.1.0-bin/hadoop1/bin$ ./sqlline.py localhost ../../examples/STOCK_SYMBOL.sql

Note that Kiji packages something that Phoenix thinks to be Hadoop 1
